Title: Observational Constraints on the Physical Properties of Interstellar 
       Dust in the Post-Planck Era 
Authors: Hensley B.S., Draine B.T.

Description of contents: This tar.gz archive file contains the data behind
    Figure 14 in the accepted version of the manuscript listed above. These
    files represent the adopted constraints on the total and polarized
    extinction from dust in the diffuse ISM, and in the bottom panel the
    adopted constraints on the total and polarized emission from
    interstellar dust. The specific files are as follows: 
    
ext_summary.mrt    : Adopted constraints on total extinction as a function of wavelength.
extpol_summary.mrt : Adopted constraints on polarized extinction as a function of wavelength.
ipol_summary.mrt   : Adopted constraints on polarized emission from interstellar dust
irem_summary.mrt   : Adopted constraints on total emission from interstellar dust


System requirements: The files are formatted according to the machine
    readable format used by the AAS Journals and CDS/VizieR. Specific
    information on the structure of MRT files can be found at:

        AAS: https://journals.aas.org/mrt-overview/
        CDS: http://cds.u-strasbg.fr/doc/catstd.htx

    These files can be read in python using the astropy package:

        from astropy.table import Table
        data = Table.read("ext_summary.mrt", format="ascii.cds")

Additional comments: ## Please replace this with additional comments
 or even text from the main paper useful for the AAS Journal reader. ##
