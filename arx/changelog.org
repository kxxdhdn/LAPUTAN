** v2.1 (20211202)
- ~plots.plotool~

  + Supported transformation between coordinate systems with ~self.trans~ kw
  + Supported multi-legends by adding ~reset_handles~, ~append_handles~, and ~get_handles~
  + Defined default tick settings in ~set_ax~
  + Clarified ~**kwargs~ usage in each function
  + Other kw changes
- ~plots.pplot~

- Updated tests
- Not compatible with scripts using former version ~plots.plotool~ class
** v2.0.4 (20211117)

- ~imaging.improve~
  + Allowed external wgrid input for ~smooth~
- Fixed bugs in ~plots~
  + Set default ~subpos=(0,0)~ (keep current axis)
** v2.0.3 (20211008)
- Updated output name conventions
  + 'type' outputs (e.g. ~ds~): ~header~, ~data~, ~unc~, ~wave~, ~hyperdata~, etc.

** v2.0 (20210914)
- Rename package from ~laputan~ to ~rapyuta~ due to the French pun...thus it turns to the Ghibli origin!

  + Added ~set_legend~ which supports lengend boxes outside the axes
  + Renamed ~set_border~ as ~set_fig~ and added suptitle
  + ~set_ax~
    * Added font size kw
    * Renamed ~xlab~ as ~xlabel~ (idem. for ~ylab~, thus coherent to matplotlib)
