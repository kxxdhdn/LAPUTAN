* Version log
** v2.0 (20210914)
- Rename package from ~laputan~ to ~rapyuta~ due to the French pun...thus it turns to the Ghibli origin!
- ~plots.plotool~
  + Removed ~set_font~ and fixed font size and tick problems
  + Added ~set_legend~ which supports lengend boxes outside the axes
  + Renamed ~set_border~ as ~set_fig~ and added suptitle
  + ~set_ax~
    * Added font size kw
    * Renamed ~xlab~ as ~xlabel~ (idem. for ~ylab~, thus coherent to matplotlib)
    * Changed ~nonposx~ default value from 'sym' to 'clip'
  + Note that all kw in ~set_fig~ and ~set_ax~ can also be executed individually with ~self.ax.set_kw~
** v1.2.4 (20210820)
- Adopted Python ~warnings.warn~ for warnings in all libraries
- ~arrays.closest~: Replaced error by warning raised and ignored kw ~side~ when it is not satisfied
- ~imaging.concatenante~ (Idem. for ~respect.concat~): Removed wrange closest left/right side
** v1.2.3 (20210817)
- ~imaging.imontage~: Corrected bugs in ~coadd~ Monte-Carlo uncertainty propagation
** v1.2.2 (20210803)
- ~calib.intercalib~
  + Corrected ~correct_spec~ non-scalar gain/offset input
- ~imaging.concatenante~ (Idem. for ~respect.concat~)
  + Added kw ~keepfrag~, ~cropedge~
  + Corrected indices with sided ~closest~
** v1.2.1 (20210730)
- ~arrays.closest~
  + Added kw ~side~ (default: None)
- ~calib.intercalib~
  + Replaced ~specorrect~ kw ~factor~ by ~gain~
  + Non-scalar ~gain~ and ~offset~
  + Renamed ~specorrect~ as ~correct_spec~
  + Extended ~wcenter~ to ~read_filter~ considering discrepancy between broad band offset and spectral offset
- Removed ~maths.f_lin_p~
** v1.2 (20210722)
- Rewrote ~imaging.imontage~
  + Added ~reproject_function~ kw
  + ~reproject~ can do 3D cube reprojection without slicing (by deleting SIP kw)
  + Updated tests
  + Archived ~reproject~ v0.4 version as ~imontage_v0_4~
- ~imaging.improve~
  + Corrected ~self.hdr~ and added ~self.hdred~
  + Added ~reinit~ (used for auto-updating after ~crop~ and ~rebin~)
  + Rewrote ~rebin~ with fractional rebinning and NaN extrapolation
- ~astrom.fixwcs~
  + Added kw ~mode~ with ~'red_dim'~ (default) and ~'del_sip'~ modes
- Added ~wcs~ to ~inout.read_fits~ output dataset
** v1.1.6 (20210701)
- Added ~maths.f_lin_p~
- ~imaging.iswarp~
  + Corrected ~combine~ 2D FITS writing
** v1.1.5 (20210625)
- Added ~imaging.iuncert~
- ~imaging.improve~
  + Renamed ~uncestimate~ as ~uncert~ and added weighted kw ~wgtbg~, ~filWGT~
- ~calib.intercalib~
  + Corrected ~specorrect~ FITS writing (invalid header) and added spatial crop kw ~xlim~, ~ylim~
  + Added ~wcenter~
- ~plots.pplot~
  + Tuned with ~plots.plotool~ changes
- ~plots.plotool~
  + Modified ~plot~ kw to assimilate that of ~matplotlib.pyplot.errorbar~
  + Set ~set_ax~ passive
  + Added ~set_clib~
- Added ~utilities.merge_aliases~
- Modified package name as Library of Astronomical Python Utility Tool for Astrophysics Nerds
** v1.1.4 (20210624)
- ~plots.plotool~
  + Deleted ~Cartesian~ (replaced by ~matplotlib.pyplot.errorbar~)
  + Extended ~plot~ kw
- ~imaging.iswarp~
  + Switched ~combine~ kw ~cropedge~ default to False
- ~imaging.Jy_per_pix_to_MJy_per_sr~
  + Corrected errors and added tests
** v1.1.3 (20210623)
- ~imaging.improve~
  + Corrected ~rebin~ 3D FITS writing (lack of wavelength HDU)
** v1.1.2 (20210622)
