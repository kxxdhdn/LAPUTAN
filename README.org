~rapyuta~ is a Python package for manipulating, cleaning, processing, analyzing, and visualizing astronomical data.
~rapyuta~ compiles several software/libraries/scripts in various programming languages (Python, IDL, Fortran, C, /etc./) used in astronomy/astrophysics and provides a consistent Python interface.
** Laputa: Castle in the Sky / 天空の城ラピュタ (Tenkū no Shiro Rapyuta)
Laputan is an inhabitant of a flying island in Swift's Gulliver's Travels characterized by a neglect of useful occupations and a devotion to visionary projects.

** Installation
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
## Python env control via conda (recommanded)
conda create --name py310 python=3.10
## Under the RAPYUTA root path (optional)
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Uninstall
pip uninstall rapyuta
#+END_SRC
** Dependencies
*** Python 
The current release of ~rapyuta~ library was developed under Python 3.10 and has been tested for Python >=3.8 versions.
We constantly update the Python environment in order to have access to the latest features.
*** [[https://github.com/kxxdhdn/laputan/tree/main/idl][IDL]]
The well-justified image convolution module was originally written in IDL.
A pure Python convolving function as an alternative is under the test.
*** [[https://www.astromatic.net/software/swarp][SWarp]]
The official download links of SWarp are currently dead.
For MacOS users, check [[./arx][here]] to download the latest version 2.38.0
*** [[https://github.com/kxxdhdn/laputan/tree/main/swing][SwING]]
Required by the synthetic photometry module.
