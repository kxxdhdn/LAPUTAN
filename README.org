~rapyuta~ is a Python package for manipulating, cleaning, processing, analyzing, and visualizing astronomical data.
~rapyuta~ compiles several software/libraries/scripts in various programming languages (Python, IDL, Fortran, C, /etc./) used in astronomy/astrophysics and provides a consistent Python interface.
** Castle in the Sky: Laputa
Castle in the Sky: Laputa (Japanese: 天空の城ラピュタ, Hepburn: Tenkū no Shiro Rapyuta) is a 1986 Japanese animated fantasy adventure film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki.
We also refer to the flying island in /Swift's Gulliver's Travels/, whose inhabitants, the Laputans, are characterized by a neglect of useful occupations and a devotion to visionary projects.

*** Python 
The current release of ~rapyuta~ library was developed under Python 3.10 and has been tested for Python >=3.8 versions.
We constantly update the Python environment in order to have access to the latest features.
*** [[https://github.com/kxxdhdn/laputan/tree/main/idl][IDL]]
The well-justified image convolution module was originally written in IDL.
A pure Python convolving function as an alternative is under the test.
*** [[https://www.astromatic.net/software/swarp][SWarp]]
The official download links of SWarp are currently dead.
For MacOS users, check [[./arx][here]] to download the latest version 2.38.0
*** [[https://github.com/kxxdhdn/laputan/tree/main/swing][SwING]]
Required by the synthetic photometry module.
